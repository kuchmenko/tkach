//! Anthropic prompt caching via `stream()`.
//!
//! Regression test for the streaming Usage merge: the API sends
//! `cache_creation_input_tokens` / `cache_read_input_tokens` on the
//! `message_start` event only, NOT on `message_delta`. The provider
//! re-stamps the running cache fields onto every emitted Usage event
//! so a consumer that takes "the latest Usage" never observes the
//! cache fields collapse to 0 mid-stream.
//!
//! Two streamed calls back-to-back; the second one's final Usage
//! event must carry `cache_read_input_tokens > 0`.
//!
//! Model & size: same constraints as `anthropic_caching.rs` — the
//! cached prefix must clear ~2048 tokens at the breakpoint or
//! Anthropic silently skips caching. The example pads the system
//! block to ~3000 tokens.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... cargo run --example anthropic_caching_streaming
