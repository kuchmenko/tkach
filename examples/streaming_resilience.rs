//! Streaming resilience: three failure-shaped scenarios in one run.
//!
//! Closes the verification gaps we identified after live-running the
//! happy-path streaming examples:
//!
//! 1. **Tool failure mid-stream** — the agent calls a tool, the tool
//!    returns `is_error: true` (we ask `read` for a path that doesn't
//!    exist). The loop must NOT terminate; it should hand the error
//!    back to the model and let it produce a graceful textual
//!    explanation in a follow-up turn.
//!
//! 2. **Cancel during tool execution** — the agent issues a `bash
//!    sleep 10` tool call. The example arms a cancel timer the moment
//!    it sees `ToolUse{name:"bash"}` on the stream, fires `cancel.cancel()`
//!    while bash is sleeping, and asserts both: the bash child was
//!    killed promptly (wall time « 10s), and the outer outcome is
//!    `AgentError::Cancelled`.
//!
//! 3. **Multi-block assistant turn** — Anthropic emits text deltas
//!    BEFORE a tool_use block in the same turn ("Let me check… *calls
//!    read*"). Our SSE state machine accumulates each block separately
//!    and reconstructs an assistant `Message` whose `content: Vec<Content>`
//!    has both a `Text` block and a `ToolUse` block. Asserting that
//!    structure proves the per-block state machine works end-to-end.
//!
//! Each phase fails the whole example with a clear panic message if
//! its specific invariant breaks. Run:
//!
//!   `cargo run --example streaming_resilience`
//!   (loads ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from .env or env)
