//! Anthropic prompt caching via `complete()`.
//!
//! Sends the same long-prefix request twice in a row. The first call
//! writes the cache (`cache_creation_input_tokens` > 0); the second
//! call hits it (`cache_read_input_tokens` > 0). On a hit, the cached
//! input tokens are billed at 0.1x base input cost.
//!
//! What gets cached:
//!   - one large stable system block (the bulk of the prefix)
//!   - the toolset (last tool's cache_control caches all preceding
//!     tools too)
//!
//! What rotates per-call:
//!   - the user message
//!
//! Model & size: Anthropic enforces a **minimum cacheable prefix
//! size** at the breakpoint. Per official docs (2026-04-30):
//!   - Claude Sonnet 4.6          → 2,048 tokens minimum
//!   - Claude Haiku 4.5           → 4,096 tokens minimum
//!   - Claude Opus 4.x            → 4,096 tokens minimum
//!   - Claude Haiku 3.5           → 2,048 tokens minimum
//!   - Claude Sonnet 4.5 / 3.7    → 1,024 tokens minimum
//!
//! The API silently skips caching (cache_creation_input_tokens=0)
//! when the prefix is below the threshold. The example uses Sonnet 4.6
//! (2,048 minimum) and pads the system block to ~2,783 tokens —
//! comfortably above the threshold without requiring a larger build.
//! Switch to Haiku 4.5 only after padding to 4,096+ tokens.
//!
//! Run with:

For required-but-occasionally-null columns, prefer .unwrap_or(default) at read time over schema-level NOT NULL only if you genuinely accept the default. Otherwise enforce NOT NULL in a migration and fail loudly at insert time.",

            "Q: Why does my async function need to be Send?",
            "A: Because the runtime moves the future across threads at .await points. If the future holds a non-Send value across an .await (like Rc, RefCell, or a !Send guard), it can't be Send. Drop the offending value before the await or switch to a Send equivalent (Arc, Mutex, parking_lot). The error message points at the captured value's span — read that, not the function signature.",

The Tokio ecosystem is larger (tonic, axum, sqlx), so most production code lands there by gravity. async-std has cleaner naming and shipped first, but its ecosystem stalled.
