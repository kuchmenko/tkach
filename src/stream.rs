//! Streaming primitives.
//!
//! `complete()` returns a buffered final answer; `stream()` returns the
//! same answer as a sequence of events as the model produces them. The
//! event types are deliberately coarser than the wire format — we
//! aggregate provider-side delta JSON into atomic `ToolUse` events
//! before emitting, so consumers never have to parse partial JSON.
//!
//! The stream item type is `Result<StreamEvent, ProviderError>`. Errors
//! that surface mid-stream (parser failures, mid-body HTTP glitches)
//! arrive as `Err`. Errors that happen before the stream starts
//! (auth, malformed request, connect refused) are returned by the
//! `stream(...)` async fn itself.
